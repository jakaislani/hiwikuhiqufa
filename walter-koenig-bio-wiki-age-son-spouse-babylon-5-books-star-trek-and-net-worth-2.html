This sets up various interesting plot tensions involving Delwyn, Rice, and Rice’s CO, Capt. Cambridge, played by&nbsp;Robert Vaughn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=walter-koenig-babylon-5></span>Walter Koenig Babylon 5<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Koenig plays the role of Alfred Bester in the film Babylon 5.
