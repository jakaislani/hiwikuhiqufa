Prior to becoming a mainstream politician, he worked as a parliamentary assistant for the then First Minister Alex Salmond.</p><p>Yousaf also worked under the then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and also served in numerous junior ministerial roles.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>READ ALSO: <a href=#>Humza Yousaf Parents: Who Are Humza Yousaf Parents?</a></h4><p>From 2012 to 2014, he served as Minister for External Affairs and International Development, and from 2014 to 2016, he served as Minister for Europe and International Development.</p><p>Yousaf also worked as the Minister for Transport and the Islands from 2016 to 2018. That same year (2018), he was appointed to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Nicola Sturgeon’s 2018 cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>Yousaf then became the first non-white cabinet minister in the Scottish Government. In 2021, he worked as Health Secretary and since has been leading the Scottish Government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.</p><p>As a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Yousaf has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow Pollok since 2016 and previously represented the Glasgow region from 2011 to 2016.</p><p>In February 2023, Yousaf made headlines when he declared his candidacy for Yousaf leadership and First Minister of Scotland after Nicola Sturgeon announced her resignation.</p><p>Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon happens to be a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National Party since 2014.</p><p>On Wednesday, February 15, 2023, she (Nicola Sturgeon) announced that she would resign as first minister and Scottish National Party leader once a new leader is elected.</p><p>Following Nicola Sturgeon’s announcement to resign, Humza Yousaf as well as former minister, Ash Regan, and finance minister, Kate Forbes officially announced bids to occupy her position.</p><p>However, Humza Yousaf has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Sturgeon pledging to uphold Nicola Sturgeon’s socially progressive policy agenda.</p><p>On Monday, February 20, Yousaf said that he backs Sturgeon’s stances on same-sex marriage, abortion clinic buffer zones, banning conversion practices, and gender recognition changes.</p><p>He added that he would “absolutely” challenge the UK government’s block on Holyrood’s gender recognition bill.</p><p>Humza Yousaf said the UK government’s decision to block the bill, which recent polls suggest is supported by a majority of Scottish voters, was in reality “an assault, an attack” on Holyrood’s autonomy.</p><p>The leadership of the Scottish National Party has said it will choose a new leader within six weeks through a ballot of its members, which will close on March 27.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Humza Yousaf Wife: Who Is Humza Yousaf Wife?</h2><p>We are not very sure as to whether or not Humza Yousaf is married. However, he was married to a former Scottish National Party worker, Gail Lythgoe from 2010 to 2016.</p><p>In 2019, he got married to Nadia El-Nakla, a psychologist and they had a child together as well as a stepchild. We can’t emphatically state whether or not Yousaf is still married to his second wife, Nadia.</p><p>He keeps his private life away from the eyes of the public hence not much is known about his current relationship with Nadia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqGsprKRYsawwdKanWavmZuybsPHqGSiq12dwq7GwGawqK2jlrNuw8ifnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-stamos-unveiled-the-hidden-past-of-doreen-lioy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Stamos Unveiled the Hidden Past of Doreen Lioy">&larr;
