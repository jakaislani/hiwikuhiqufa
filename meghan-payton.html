In addition to her successful career, she is well-known in the media as the daughter of former Saints coach Sean Payton. She, like her father, is an avid sports fan.</strong></p><p>She has a solid professional career, no doubt, but what about her family relationships? We know she loves her father, but what about her mother? Sean Shuey, her father, divorced his ex-wife Beth Shuey in 2012 when their daughter was only 15 years old. Is Meghan as close to her mother as she is to her father? We’ll find out soon enough.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Meghan_Payton_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Meghan Payton? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Sean Payton is a multi-millionaire, as we all know. He has a massive net worth of <strong>$24 million.</strong> His daughter, Meghan, on the other hand, has a massive net worth of <strong>$1-5 million dollars</strong>. As previously stated, her primary source of income is her work as a sportscaster and analyst.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Meghan_Payton_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Meghan Payton born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Meghan Payton was<strong> born in 1996,</strong> the daughter of former football coach/quarterback Sean Payton and mother Beth Shuey. Her birth occurred four years after her parent’s marriage. She will be 26 years old in 2022.</p><p>Payton is an Irish Catholic on her father’s side. Although she was born in Texas, she spent the majority of her childhood in Mandeville, Louisiana, where her father was named head coach of the Saints. She lived there for a half-decade before returning to Dallas, Texas. Meghan is also not the only child of her divorced parents. She has a younger brother, Connor Payton, who will be 22 in March 2022.</p><p>Payton enrolled in Argyle Liberty Christian School after returning to her birthplace. She joined the cheerleading squad there until her graduation in 2015. She went on to Pepperdine University to study Media Production and Sports Broadcasting after graduating.</p><p>Meghan’s parents are not together: they divorced in 2012.<br>Sean and Beth, Payton’s parents, divorced in June 2012 after nearly 20 years of marriage. This must have had an impact on this sports broadcaster, who was only 15 at the time.</p><h2><span id=Is_Meghan_Payton_Single_Relationship_Boyfriend>Is Meghan Payton Single? Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Meghan, the daughter of this former head coach, is currently engaged to Christopher Titone. The lovely couple recently announced their engagement on March 23, 2022. They met somewhere in 2015 and hit it off right away.</p><p>Titone, unlike his lovely bride-to-be, is a writer and actor. Home Team is a film he wrote that is loosely based on the life of his father-in-law. It is a well-known Netflix film that tells the story of Sean Payton’s life during his suspension from the 2012 NFL season.</p><p>Furthermore, Meghan’s future husband, Christopher, has worked as a comedian in films such as Hubie Halloween, The Wrong Missy, and Father of the Year. This upcoming comedy actor is Adam Sandler’s brother-in-law. This means Titone is Jackie Sandler’s brother, who is also an actress.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Meghan_Payton_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Meghan Payton start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Payton, as previously stated, enjoys sports just as much as her father. Sean Payton is a legendary name in American football. From 2006 to 2021, he was the head coach of the New Orleans Saints. He also led the team to its first Super Bowl victory in 2009 during his tenure. Meghan’s father, in addition, is a former quarterback.</p><p>Even though Meghan is not physically interested in sports, she has chosen a career that is closely related to sports. In a nutshell, she is a sports broadcaster. She interned for NFL Network while in college. After graduation in 2019, she was hired as a sideline reporter for the New Orleans Saints. This is also when she had the opportunity to interview her father. This father-daughter team must have been overjoyed.</p><p>She recently began working at Chat Sports as an on-air host for all of their NFL platforms, beginning in August 2021. As a result, Meghan Payton is now a household name on the NFL network. She is still doing an outstanding job of covering sports news.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Sports Agent</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jaedah Tofaeono</a></h3>Who is Jaedah Tofaeono?
