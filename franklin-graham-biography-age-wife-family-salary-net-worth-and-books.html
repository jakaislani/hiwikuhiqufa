The focus of these rallies was to challenge Christians to pray for the United States and its leaders and to live and promote Biblical principles at home, in public, and at the ballot box. The Decision America Tour is continuing this year with multi-city stops in Tennessee and Texas. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association appointed Franklin Graham CEO in 2000 and president of the organization in 2001.</p><p>As a speaker and author, Franklin regularly addresses current moral and social issues, calling Christians to stand for Biblical values and challenging them to make a difference in the world for the sake of the Gospel. He also offers Biblical context and application to current national and world events. Through the organizations, he leads he has been instrumental in helping people impacted by crises including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the civil war in Sudan and natural disasters ranging from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to earthquakes in Japan, Haiti, and China.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-age></span><span>Franklin Graham Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born on July 14, 1952.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-family></span><span>Franklin Graham Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Graham was born in Asheville, North Carolina to Billy Graham and Ruth Bell Franklin, Graham is the fourth of the five children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=franklin-graham-wife></span><span>Franklin Graham Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He married Jane Austin Cunningham of Smithfield, North Carolina, in 1974.
