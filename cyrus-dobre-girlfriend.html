Under Carroll’s leadership, the Seahawks have made significant achievements.</p><p>Notably, the team’s Legion of Boom defense, under Carroll, led the league in scoring defense for four consecutive seasons. Delve into his married life with details including his ex-wife, wife, children, and many more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peter Carroll’s first marriage lasted for only two years&nbsp;</h2><p>Carroll has had an interesting personal life, particularly in terms of his marriages. His first marriage was to Wendy Pearl in 1973, and despite keeping their relationship details private, the couple divorced in 1975 after only two years of marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>The specific reasons for their separation remain undisclosed, as Carroll and Wendy chose to keep their private matters away from the public eye. The ex-wife continued to stay away from the media and public attention and has deliberately maintained a low profile since the divorce.</p><p>After the brief marriage with Wendy, the football coach quickly remarried less than a year later. As per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">source</a>, this suggested that the NFL coach may have already been involved with his current wife during his divorce from Pearl.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to her previous visibility during her marriage to the NFL coach, Pearl has chosen to stay out of the limelight, possibly to avoid the relentless scrutiny that often comes with being associated with a public figure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pete Carroll married his current wife, Glena Goranson, within the year of the divorce&nbsp;</h2><p>As for Carroll, he moved on from his first marriage and married Glena Goranson on May 21, 1976. The couple shares a connection through their shared background as college athletes. Born in the year 1955, she is 68 years old as of 2023.</p><p>Despite Carroll’s prominent position in the limelight, the couple has chosen to keep their family life discreet.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clutch Points</a>&nbsp;mentioned that Goranson pursued her education at the University of the Pacific, the same college attended by Carroll.&nbsp;</p><p>While Carroll was involved in football, Goranson played on the university’s volleyball team. The couple exchanged wedding vows in 1976, and since then, the coach has made a conscious effort to shield their family’s affairs from the public eye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pete Carroll and Glena Goranson have 3 children together&nbsp;</h2><p>Since their marriage, the couple has welcomed three children: Brennan, Jamie, and Nate. Despite their efforts to maintain privacy, the family’s achievements have made it challenging to stay out of the public sphere.</p><p>Brennan, presently serving as the offensive coordinator for the Arizona Wildcats, previously played as a tight end for the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>He took on various roles within USC’s football program under his father, starting as a graduate assistant and progressing to the positions of tight ends coach and recruitment coordinator by 2007. Brennan also contributed to the Seahawks staff before transitioning to the University of Arizona.&nbsp;</p><p>Jaime, a real estate professional, has a background that extends beyond her current profession. She previously played a significant role on the business side of Compete to Create, a performance institute founded by Carroll. Additionally, she showcased her athletic prowess as a valuable member of the USC volleyball team.</p><p>Nate, on the other hand, serves as the Senior Offensive Assistant for the Seattle Seahawks. Despite being a three-star athlete in high school, he chose to prioritize academics over playing college football.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating from USC with a degree in Psychology, Nate received a job offer from his father to join the Seattle Seahawks after completing his education. Since then, he has been a consistent presence with the team, notably contributing to the Super Bowl victory alongside his father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pete Carroll faced a relationship controversy involving a college grad</h2><p>Carroll’s commitment to maintaining privacy in his family life once again became apparent in 2009 when rumors surfaced regarding the coach’s personal life. The speculation emerged after comments from Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis suggested a possible connection between Carroll and a USC graduate student.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gbissue.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pete_Carroll.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Pete Carroll watching an Eclipse (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Carroll refuted these allegations, and no other credible sources were able to corroborate Weis’ claims. Consequently, the rumors faded away without gaining significant traction.</p><p>Despite the challenges brought about by such rumors, there is undeniable evidence of the strong and special relationship between Carroll and Goranson. Their ability to weather the challenges of constant movement and stress associated with being a football coach speaks to the strength of their bond.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pete Carroll excelled as a multisport athlete in high school</h2><p>Carroll was born on September 15, 1951, in San Francisco, California, to Rita and James Edward. His paternal great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, while his Croatian maternal grandparents emigrated from the Šibenik region.&nbsp;</p><p>Raised in Greenbrae, California, he attended Greenbrae School and later went on to Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. Carroll excelled as a multi-sport athlete, participating in football (as a quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back), basketball, and baseball.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>His outstanding performance earned him the title of Athlete of the Year during his senior year in 1969, as mentioned by the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LA Times</a>. In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the charter class of the Redwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame in April 2009.</p><p>Following high school, Carroll began his college journey at the College of Marin, a junior college, where he played football for two years. He then transferred to the University of the Pacific, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.&nbsp;</p><p>During his time at Pacific, Carroll played free safety for the Tigers, receiving All-Pacific Coast Athletic Association honors in both 1971 and 1972. In 1973, he earned his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.</p><p>Fast-forward to the present, Carroll stands as one of three head coaches to achieve both a college football national championship and an NFL championship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkp7AtMHEZ5qopV%2Bnsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1wr9irrKxllKSvs7GMoKCrpJantqa6w2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-dill-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Dill   Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
