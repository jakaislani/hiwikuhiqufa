Her calls to his management went unanswered, so she took on a different approach. “If I can’t be in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, I want to make a record that sounds as much like T.P.’s as possible,” she said in his biography.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she started working on her own music outside of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks turned to everyone in Petty’s circle. “She didn’t have a band, she didn’t have a single and she didn’t have anyone to produce her record,” rock biographer Stephen Davis told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/five-things-might-not-know-stevie-nicks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Interview class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Interview</a>. “She basically stole the Heartbreakers from Tom Petty, stole his producer Jimmy Iovine and then stole their next single, which was ‘Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around.’ She got everything she wanted.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it didn’t quite happen that fast. As Petty detailed in his biography, he had opted not to produce her album, despite the fact that Nicks said she would cater her schedule to his. So he put her in touch with Iovine instead. Nicks told Iovine she wanted to be a “girl Tom Petty” in 1979. Ironically, two weeks later, she was living with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=pKrgBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22%27She+came+into+my+life+like+a+rocket,+just+refusing+to+go+away,%27%22&source=bl&ots=YhZZfK2ZZq&sig=ACfU3U1rn58vEDM9IoSiQOQcDyiUr3bIWQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG2NSKs9LpAhUCmeAKHf91ApoQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=stevie&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Iovine as his girlfriend" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Iovine as his girlfriend</a>.</p><img alt="Stevie Nicks Tom Petty" title="Stevie Nicks Tom Petty" width=2149 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2670321.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty in 2003; Photo: Carlo Allegri/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Petty wrote “Insider” for Nicks — but then took it back</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While that should have been an intimate link to Petty, Iovine attempted to separate his work and personal life. Eventually, Nicks started showing up when Petty and the Heartbreakers were around. “We weren’t really welcoming to her,” Petty admitted in the biography. “It wasn’t like she received a lot of warmth. We weren’t impressed by superstars — it just wasn’t our nature.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Instead, Nicks got to know Petty’s then-wife Jane Benyo, who he was married to from 1974 to 1996, and eventually Petty realized how “genuine and good” Nicks was. Petty started consulting on Nicks’ record and together with Iovine decided it was missing a single, so he wrote one: “Insider.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But giving up a song wasn’t easy for Petty, especially when he realized it was one of the strongest he’d ever written, so he took it back, but kept her vocals in. At least that’s the way the story was told in Petty’s biography. However, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/tom-pettys-50-greatest-songs-197807/insider-198443/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> says it was Nicks who gave the song back.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However it happened, there was definitely a professional spark. “There was a chemistry between Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks that made people wonder,” Zanes wrote in the biography. “There was something, in phrasing and tone, about the way the voices lay against each other.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Their duet “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” was a hit</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nicks was still missing a song from her 1981 debut solo album, Bella Donna, so Petty gave her another song, “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around.” Not only did it stay on the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/stevie-nicks/chart-history/HSI/song/580639 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Billboard charts for 21 weeks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Billboard charts for 21 weeks</a>, peaking at No. 3 on September 5, 1981, but it also happened to coincide with the launch of MTV — with the video becoming a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/five-things-might-not-know-stevie-nicks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="staple of the young network" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">staple of the young network</a> in its early days when it actually focused on playing music videos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Had he not given me that song, let me candidly tell you, Bella Donna might not have been a hit,” Nicks told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/stevie-nicks-interview-tom-petty-drag-queens-game-of-thrones-prince-801112/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>. “That song kicked Bella Donna right into the universe.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Petty gave Nicks 'hard advice' when she needed it</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the years, their relationship strengthened. Petty gave Nicks the famous star she wore on her top hats. And he continued to influence her songwriting — even if it meant giving her tough lessons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nicks recalled a time in 1994 when she had just come out of rehab and was shaken up by a visit from an old boyfriend. “I had dinner with [Petty] at the Ritz-Carlton,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/stevie-nicks-on-the-last-time-she-saw-tom-petty-201744/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>. “I asked Tom if he would help me write a song and he said, ‘No. You are one of the premier songwriters of all time. You don’t need me to write a song for you.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was right. That blunt rejection forced her to go home and write. She came up with “Hard Advice,” which ended up on her 2014 album 24 Karat Gold with the lyrics, “Sometimes he’s my best friend.” Nicks later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/stevie-nicks-on-the-last-time-she-saw-tom-petty-201744/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>, “It’s really, ‘Sometimes Tom’s my best friend.’ I changed it because I knew Tom would not want me to say his name. That’s how well I know him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And that wasn’t the only Nicks song that Petty influenced. “Edge of Seventeen” from Bella Donna came from a conversation Nicks had with Petty’s wife Jane about how they met when Jane was 17. While Nicks has admitted that the song is about John Lennon’s murder, she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6266329/stevie-nicks-interview-on-don-henley-fleetwood-mac-24-karat-gold-album data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billboard</a> that it’s also “a little bit about Tom,” citing the lyrics, “He seemed broken-hearted / Somethin’ within him.” Nicks explained that those were words that Jane told her about Petty at the time.</p><img alt="Stevie Nicks Tom Petty" title="Stevie Nicks Tom Petty" width=3000 height=2529 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-634672418.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Nicks and Petty in 2017; Photo: Kevin Mazur/WireImage</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Their chemistry was electric</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Whenever they performed together, romantic relationship rumors would startup. While they were never officially linked, they’ve both expressed their relationship in intimate ways.<br tml-linebreak=true></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It’s really easy for Tom and I to be theatrical on stage because we both like it,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/music/2017/10/03/tom-petty-stevie-nicks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Weekly</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/music/2017/10/03/tom-petty-stevie-nicks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=".

When Petty was asked about their friendship, he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://torontosun.com/2014/07/24/tom-petty-taking-it-all-in-stride-ahead-of-hypnotic-eye-release/wcm/fa200e6c-21e3-4aaa-bff2-b9712d6cc35d data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Toronto Sun" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Toronto Sun</a>, “Have you got a couple of hours? She’s a good friend. I’ve known her since 1978 and she’s insisted on being in my life. Some of my best musical memories of her are sitting on the couch and just playing the guitar while she sings.”</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nicks admired Petty’s empathy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Of all the traits Nicks admired about Petty, she was most drawn to his unique sense of understanding and ability to write about women with empathy. She chalked it up to his two daughters and his two loving wives (after separating from Jane, he married Dana York in 2001). “He was surrounded by really strong women,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/stevie-nicks-on-the-last-time-she-saw-tom-petty-201744/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>. “The women around him pretty much went their own way, and he was good with that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That made Nicks turn to him for advice often. “Tom was a completely masculine personality, but it softened him and made him much more understanding,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/remembering-tom-petty-1950-2017-202043/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>, adding that she was “never afraid to pick up the phone and explain a situation to him — and he would just talk me down.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And it’s that bond the two musicians that truly linked them. In fact, when Nicks received a major honor in 2019, her only regret was Petty’s absence. “My biggest sadness about the Hall of Fame is that Tom is not here to enjoy this with me,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/stevie-nicks-interview-tom-petty-drag-queens-game-of-thrones-prince-801112/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>. “He would have been the proudest of me of anyone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJoq6ilXaWytcDYZqqtnaaesm66yJyirGWWp7amusOsn6Ko</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nassau-county-says-it-will-close-nickerson-beach-to-non-residents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nassau County says it will close Nickerson beach to non-residents">&larr;
