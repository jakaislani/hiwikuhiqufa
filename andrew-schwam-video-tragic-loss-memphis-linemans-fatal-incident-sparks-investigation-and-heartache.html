The community is left grappling for answers, while the details of the incident continue to be unraveled.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Dark_Day_Unfolds></span><span>A Dark Day Unfolds</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=ez-toc-title>Nội Dung Bài Viết:</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle></span><p><span>The victim of this heartrending incident has been identified as Andrew Schwam, a 35-year-old graduate of Houston High School, who was a dedicated utility lineman. Andrew Schwam, alongside a fellow crew member, was diligently engaged in the installation of a crucial cable on utility poles for Tri-State Utility Construction when tragedy struck unexpectedly. For more information on this incident, you can refer to the “<strong>Andrew Schwam video</strong>.”</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/andrew-schwam-video-2.jpg alt width=870 height=492 sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span><strong>Related posts:</strong></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Unfortunate_Chain_of_Events></span><span>The Unfortunate Chain of Events</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>According to accounts provided by Porsche Schwam, Andrew’s grief-stricken wife, the calamity was set into motion when a Blount County sheriff’s deputy inadvertently drove over a portion of the cable. In an unfortunate turn of events, the cable became ensnared on the deputy’s rear tire, leading to its snap-back and a catastrophic impact on Andrew. The force of the impact propelled him nearly 36 feet, resulting in a fatal head injury.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Devastating_Outcome></span><span>A Devastating Outcome</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In the aftermath of the incident, Porsche Schwam shared the heart-rending details of the injuries sustained by her late husband. “The cable shattered his pelvis, his sternum was fractured, and multiple ribs were broken, evident from the extensive swelling across his body,” Porsche recounted. She found a semblance of solace in the knowledge that Andrew’s passing was swift, sparing him prolonged suffering.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Seeking_Answers_and_Accountability></span><span>Seeking Answers and Accountability</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In the wake of Andrew’s untimely demise, his sister took to TikTok to voice her concerns and assign blame to the Blount County deputy involved in the accident. The grieving family’s quest for accountability has been fueled by a lack of communication from the sheriff’s department. “It has been four agonizing days, and the sheriff’s office has not reached out to me or any other family member,” Porsche lamented.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Official_Response_and_Ongoing_Investigation></span><span>Official Response and Ongoing Investigation</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Blount County Sheriff Mark Moon, currently attending a National Sheriffs Institute leadership seminar in Washington, DC, acknowledged the circulating TikTok video. He assured the public that an active investigation was underway regarding the events that transpired in the Hayden area on March 18th. He cautioned against hasty judgments and expressed condolences to both the bereaved family and the deputy involved.</span></p><p><span>Chief Deputy Brian Whitt of the sheriff’s department shed light on the ongoing investigations conducted by OSHA and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA). He affirmed the department’s commitment to a thorough examination of the incident, with the intention of revealing the comprehensive narrative. Whitt dispelled media speculations that the deputy’s vehicle had struck Andrew, clarifying that this was not the case.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Andrew_Schwam_video_Remembering_Andrew_Schwam></span><span>Andrew Schwam video:Remembering Andrew Schwam</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Porsche Schwam, left to grapple with the immense void left by her husband’s passing, shared poignant details about Andrew’s life and character. Despite his relatively short tenure as a lineman, Andrew Schwam had exhibited dedication and responsibility in his role. A father of four, aged 17, 12, 5, and 1, he was committed to his family and his work. For a deeper insight into Andrew’s life and the impact he made, you can watch the “<strong>Andrew Schwam video.”</strong></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Demanding_Accountability></span><span>Demanding Accountability</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Porsche Schwam echoed the family’s conviction that the tragedy was not a result of Andrew’s actions but of unforeseen circumstances. She demanded that those responsible for the accident be held accountable. “His life was needlessly taken away while he was dutifully carrying out his responsibilities. We demand justice,” she asserted.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Beacon_of_Hope_in_a_Time_of_Despair></span><span>A Beacon of Hope in a Time of Despair</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In the midst of their grief, the Schwam family has rallied together to support one another and honor Andrew’s memory. A GoFundMe page has been established by Andrew’s sister to assist with the family’s financial burdens. Furthermore, Porsche Schwam has enlisted the services of Memphis attorney Jeff Rosenblum, who has begun to explore legal avenues, including questioning the role of Tri-State Utility Construction in this tragic event.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/andrew-schwam-video-1.jpg alt width=676 height=539 sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Unanswered_Questions_and_Pending_Statements></span><span>Unanswered Questions and Pending Statements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Tri-State Utility Construction, headquartered in Chattanooga, has chosen to remain silent in the aftermath of the incident. However, Kyle McClure, the company’s Director of Operations, took a moment to acknowledge Andrew Schwam’s contributions as an exemplary employee. The company has hinted at releasing an official statement in due course.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Legacy_of_Compassion></span><span>A Legacy of Compassion</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Andrew Schwam’s legacy of compassion and generosity continues even after his passing. As a registered organ donor, his liver has been matched with a friend of the family’s father, who is in dire need of a transplant. In this selfless act, Andrew’s spirit lives on, providing a lifeline to another in need.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Glimpse_of_the_Future></span><span>A Glimpse of the Future</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>As investigations press forward and the details of that fateful day are meticulously pieced together, the community awaits a thorough and transparent resolution. Blount County Sheriff’s Office assures the public that the deputy involved remains on duty, while the Schwam family seeks closure, justice, and an enduring tribute to the life of Andrew Schwam.</span></p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>9</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaGuucXLmqWdq16YvK561admmqaUp7K4edKcn7CZnWLDqrDEqGStqpGctqR5y6iqrGWdmrqxtMisZKWhnpq6orrSZp2arJGheqq6wqKbnqakYsCxrdGkqmahnquytMDIoJitoZ%2BjeqK6w2afnpmiqa6ktMRo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./molly-kelly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Molly Kelly">&larr;
