Gina is an actress, best known for her roles in “The Bold and the Beautiful” and “Filly Brown”. She gained further recognition for portraying Jane Villanueva in the series “Jane the Virgin” and has significantly contributed to her current net worth.</p><p>As of mid-2016, sources state her net worth to be over $5 million, largely accumulated through her successful acting career. Apart from television, she has also ventured into various film roles and holds several prestigious awards. It is expected that her wealth will continue to grow as she progresses in her career.</p><h3>Gina Rodriguez: Net Worth of $5 Million</h3><p>Gina’s journey in the entertainment industry began at a young age when she joined Fantasia Juvenil, a salsa dance company. She pursued her passion for dance while at St. Ignatius College Prep and later became a part of Columbia University’s Theatrical Collaboration. After high school, she pursued a degree in Fine Arts from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 2006. During this period, she also honed her skills at the Atlantic Theater Company and gained recognition for her involvement in the production “The Last Moments in the Life of Frida Kahlo”.</p><p>In 2011, Gina landed a role in the soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” and also starred in the film musical “Go for It!”, which earned her an Imagen Awards nomination. She continued to build her reputation with “Filly Brown”, for which she received an Imagen award and won the Best Actor Award at the First Run Film Festival. Although offered a role in the Lifetime series “Devious Maids”, she declined. In 2013, she joined the cast of “Sleeping with the Fishes”, which led to her breakthrough with the series “Jane the Virgin”. In 2014, she was also featured in “Sticky Notes”.</p><p>Besides her acting career, Rodriguez co-hosted the 2015 Teen Choice Awards alongside Josh Peck and Ludacris. It’s also been reported that she’s working on an album.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, there is limited information about her relationships. Gina discovered she had a thyroid condition at the age of 19. She has mentioned experiencing different religious influences, having been raised Catholic but now attending a Christian church despite her Jewish family background. Unlike Gina, her sisters pursued different career paths, with one becoming an investment banker and the other a doctor.</p><p>Besides her acting achievements, Gina is involved in philanthropy, supporting organizations such as CustomInk and Naja Lingerie. She serves on the board of directors for the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, having been a scholar of the organization herself. In collaboration with CustomInk and The Parent Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights, she has taken part in selling t-shirts to support the PACER cause. She has also been involved with Naja in selling products to fund school books, uniforms, and meals for those in need.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gina Rodriguez</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 30, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.61&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>St. Ignatius College Prep, New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Magali Rodriguez, Genaro Rodriguez</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon, Rebecca Rodriguez</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/HereIsGina</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/hereisgina</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/hereisgina</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm1752221</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy (2015), Young Hollywood Awards, Dorian Awards, Imagen Awards</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Comedy, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Liplock, Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy, NAACP Image Award…</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Jane the Virgin” (2014-), “The Bold and the Beautiful” (2011-2012), “Filly Brown” (2012), “Sleeping with the Fishes” (2013), “Sticky Notes”</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>California Winter (2012), Sticky Notes (2016), Army Wives (2010), No Names (2012), Teen Choice Awards (2015), “Go for It!”, “The Last Moments in the Life of Frida Kahlo” Longmire (2013)</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td>Jane the Virgin (2014)</td><td>$40,000 per episode</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=quotes><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>“I felt very vulnerable after ‘Sleeping with the Fishes’; I gained weight for the role. I felt a bit out of my skin in the movie, and it was hard to watch.”</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>“I’m not messing with skiing. You can’t get this Puerto Rican on the slope. Uh-uh.”</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>“I will play the characters with last names like Sanchez and Gonzalez until the day I die, but I also want to play the ‘Michelle Smiths.’</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>“I’ve been very lucky; God has done amazing things for me.”</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>“Being an actress wasn’t realistic. I knew that I was going to have to do it in a way that would speak to my parents. So I went to NYU Tisch School of the Arts for theater, and I studied at the conservatory.”</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>“I went to college at NYU for acting, since acting was my dream from very young. I did a lot of hip-hop courses while I was there. I helped co-write a hip-hop production for the main stage of NYU, but I never touched rap.”</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>“What makes characters real are details, and if you’re crafting a person from scratch, you’re probably not going to pay as much attention to a question like, ‘Does this person bite their nails?’</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>“I was a salsa dancer for the majority of my life, from, like, 7 to 17, and did the World Salsa Congresses. I realized that I wanted to continue obviously to be a performer. But in my household, being an actor and jumping into acting is not really accepted.”</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>“When I got out of college, I booked a movie called ‘Go for It!’ with Lionsgate, came out here, and I’ve been acting ever since – or trying, constantly trying.”</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>“I started performing very young as a salsa dancer, and every time I was on that stage dancing, all I knew was that I wanted to speak. I wanted the music to stop, and I wanted to speak.”</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>“I think all Latino actors want to be storytellers first. I want to be an actor first, and then I want to be Latina.”</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>“I love telling stories that allow people to be less afraid to tell theirs.”</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>“I grew up in Chicago, so hip-hop has always been a part of my life.”</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>“I love relatable stories.”</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>“I started small with commercials and print.”</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>“I learned a lot from Ana Ortiz, who plays my sister in ‘Sleeping with the Fishes’.”</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>“Acting is how I’ll be able to change how Latinos are viewed in media and change how little girls see and talk about themselves.”</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>“I am not going to take a role because there’s money. It might extend my checkbook, but not my integrity.”</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>“I grew up dancing salsa – you know, a traditional Puerto Rican dance.”</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>“I do not devalue the role of a maid or nanny, or the stereotypical roles that some members of our family have actually done to feed our families in real life.”</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>“With each dream accomplished, bigger ones are put in their place.”</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>“I don’t want the Latino community to think I think the reason Latino films are not doing well is because of us. It is not fully our responsibility.”</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>“I’ve specifically decided to say no to projects that weren’t advancing Latinos, that weren’t showing us in a positive light, roles that were gratuitous and spreading untruths.”</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Serves as a board member for the Hispanic Scholarship Fund.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</p><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Ferdinand</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Una (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>The Star</td><td>2017/II</td><td>announced</td><td>Mary (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Annihilation</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Anya Thorensen</td></tr><tr><td>Sharon 1.2.3.</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Cindy</td></tr><tr><td>Jane the Virgin</td><td>2014-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jane Villanueva / Jane / Cecilia</td></tr><tr><td>Deepwater Horizon</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Andrea Fleytas</td></tr><tr><td>Sticky Notes</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Natalia</td></tr><tr><td>C’est Jane</td><td>2014</td><td>Short</td><td>Jane</td></tr><tr><td>Since I Laid Eyes</td><td>2014</td><td>Short</td><td>Ilene</td></tr><tr><td>Wild Blue</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Pilar Robles</td></tr><tr><td>Interstate</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Nayeli</td></tr><tr><td>Una Y Otra Y Otra Vez</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Girlfriend</td></tr><tr><td>The Price We Pay</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Medic (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Rizzoli & Isles</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Lourdes Santana</td></tr><tr><td>Sleeping with the Fishes</td><td>2013/I</td><td></td><td>Alexis Fish</td></tr><tr><td>Longmire</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Lorna Dove</td></tr><tr><td>Enter the Dangerous Mind</td><td>2013</td><td></td><td>Adrienne</td></tr><tr><td>California Winter</td><td>2012</td><td></td><td>Ofelia Ramirez</td></tr><tr><td>No Names</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Megan</td></tr><tr><td>The Bold and the Beautiful</td><td>2011-2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Beverly</td></tr><tr><td>Filly Brown</td><td>2012</td><td></td><td>Majo Tonorio</td></tr><tr><td>The Mentalist</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Elvia</td></tr><tr><td>Happy Endings</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Rita</td></tr><tr><td>Go for It!</td><td>2011</td><td></td><td>Gina</td></tr><tr><td>My Super Psycho Sweet 16: Part 2</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Courtney</td></tr><tr><td>Army Wives</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Marisol Evans</td></tr><tr><td>Little Spoon</td><td>2010</td><td>Short</td><td>Mandy</td></tr><tr><td>10 Things I Hate About You</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Danica</td></tr><tr><td>Our Family Wedding</td><td>2010</td><td></td><td>Bridesmaid</td></tr><tr><td>Osvaldo’s</td><td>2009</td><td>Short</td><td>Ana Daisy</td></tr><tr><td>Eleventh Hour</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Robin</td></tr><tr><td>Ten: Thirty One</td><td>2008</td><td>Short</td><td>Neighborhood Girl</td></tr><tr><td>Calling It Quits</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td>Dayplayer</td></tr><tr><td>Law & Order</td><td>2004-200<h3>Related posts:</h3><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmieoqaRYr%2BwsNGinq6dqqh6uLHApauhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./giovanni-ribisi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giovanni Ribisi  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
