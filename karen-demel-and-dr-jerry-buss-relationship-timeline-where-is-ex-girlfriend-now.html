People are looking forward to the series that will reveal the investor’s personal details.</strong></p><p>Karen Demel is a renowned investor and the owner of the basketball club, Los Angeles Lakers. His story is now portrayed in the HBO series,&nbsp;Winning&nbsp;Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.</p><p>In the series, John C. Reilly plays Dr. Jerry, an imaginative investor who wants to convert the Lakers and Los Angeles Forum into an entertainment arena with all of Hollywood’s glitz and glamour.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-karen-demel-now></span>Where Is Karen Demel Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jerry Buss’ ex-girlfriend, Karen Demel, is the mother of two of his children. Buss was a businessman, investor, scientist, and philanthropist from the United States.</p><p>He was the main owner of the Los Angeles Lakers professional basketball club in the National Basketball Association (NBA). His club has won ten league titles, the most notable of which came during the team’s Showtime period in the 1980s.</p><p>As a contributor, he is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Other professional sports franchises in Southern California were owned by Buss.</p><p>He was a self-made man and had a rags-to-riches story that epitomized the American Dream. Buss, a Great Depression-era youngster living in poverty in Wyoming, faced the challenges of a blue-collar existence and began working at an early age.</p><p>Buss began his career working for his stepfather’s plumbing company, rising up at 4:30 a.m. to dig trenches on freezing ground for three hours before school.</p><p>Later in high school, Buss worked for two bucks a day at a nearby motel.</p><p>He dropped out of school to work for the railroad, later returning to get his undergraduate degree from the University of Wyoming. He also got a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Southern California.</p><p>Saving money from his first job after graduating from USC, Buss gathered four other partners in 1959 to acquire a 14-unit rental property in West Los Angeles.</p><p>He made his first investment with a $6,000 down payment and a $100,000 bank loan.</p><p>Buss transformed this $6,000 down purchase into a $350 million real estate empire eighteen years later.</p><p><strong>More On:&nbsp;</strong>Who Is Karina Veiga?

They have currently reached the age of approximately 37 and 34 years, respectively.</p><p>Dr. Jerry has an estimated net worth of $600 million at the time of his death. The majority of Jerry Buss’ wealth stemmed from his ownership of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.</p><p>He was also the former owner of the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA, the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA (soccer).</p><p>According to&nbsp;Techstry, he earned enough money in 1979 to purchase The Lakers, The Kings, and The Forum sports stadium for $67.5 million.</p><p>In today’s dollars, that equates to $213 million. It was the biggest sports franchise acquisition in history at the time. And Jerry’s Lakers won their first of ten NBA titles within a year.</p><p>Similarly, the earnings of his partner might be somewhat between $50,000 to $500,000. If only her specific occupation was divulged, it would have been easier to determine her worth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-karen-demel-married-now></span>Is Karen Demel Married Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karen Demel is not married at the time of the date. Previously, she was not even married to her lover, Dr. Jerry Buss. And now that he’s gone, we don’t think she’ll marry anyone.</p><p>However, this is simply our assumption and the news regarding her current whereabouts is unclear.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, Dr. Jerry died of kidney failure on February 18, 2013, at the age of 80. Buss was hospitalized for months in 2012 due to an unspecified digestive ailment.</p><p>Due to health concerns, he did not attend a Lakers game throughout the 2012–13 season until his 80th birthday on January 27, 2013.</p><p>Buss had been battling cancer since 2012, it was discovered on February 14, 2013, four days before his death. The whole family, including his six children, were present with him at the time of his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORp7KvecOepJ6kXZa7pXnDq2SjnaKnxm6u1KyqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV2staa%2BxGagrGWVrXqotdGlnauhlaOxbrrOsGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brie-larson-channels-the-nutcracker-by-twerking-in-a-tutu-tchaikovsky-presumably-rolls-in-his-grave.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brie Larson channels The Nutcracker by twerking in a tutu, Tchaikovsky presumably rolls in his">&larr;
